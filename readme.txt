/* This website is Manabu, a website that introduces the basics of Japanese manners and etiquettes for foreigners who have never been to Japan */

1. Overview of the project

- The index page (homepage) is manner-website.html. 

You can also go to any other pages and click on the Manabu logo on the header to return to this homepage.

- On the website, there are:
   + 1 homepage
   + 2 pages of listing manners by different categories 
   + 12 articles on each specific topic

- At the bottom of every article, there is a "Previous Article & Next Article" section. You can click on the first article (e.g. Manners at Shrines and Temples) and use it as a flow to view all the articles without having to click on each item in the manner lists. 

However, for a thorough look at the web contents, viewing the two pages of manners lists is recommended.
